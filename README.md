# qbt-rs

A collection of interesting Qbittorrent interactions in Rust.

This is one of my first major projects to learn Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> Code quality is... less than optimal.

# Major Features

- Rust client-side bindings for the Qbittorrent API (near feature-complete).
- A libfuse based VFS for interacting with the Qbittorrent API (far from complete).

More details coming soon!
